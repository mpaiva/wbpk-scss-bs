Webpack + SASS + Bootstrap Boilerplate - A lean boilerplate for those who can't decide which JS library to use.

If you are sick and tired of people asking about the Angular and React and want to only focus on the beauty of the modern web development workflow, this boilerplate does just that.

**No-Javascript-ish** **boilerplate for the un-deciders**, designers or people that simply love HTML and CSS/SASS.

The only Javascript you will dip on is Webpack, which is already set and it is well commented with you in mind.

## The WestWorld of Web Development

**TLTR** - Don't code in an uncivilized world. Webpack is a task runner that will bundle all your HTML and CSS in the best way possible! It will make you look like a machine!

>Let's assume that you don't know shit about modern web development.

### Wild West of front-end development

In the old days of salvage in the west-world of BrowserLand, people used to write HTML and CSS from scratch, without much thinking and patience to keep the code clean, lean and "dry".

One of the biggest and most painful challenges for the early CSS-developers was to manage thousands of lines of code, hundreds of class names, an avalanche of repetitive and redundant properties like colors, font sizes, spacing, etc.

Even worse, the **bloated CSS files** were responsible for poor performance, long loading time and even crashing web browsers.  

### Webpack to the rescue

Webpack is a module bundler that takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

In other words, it's like having the best CSS developer in your team going over your code and removing all the unnecessary crap you left behind.

### Webpack benefits on CSS
Webpack only bundles what is actually being used by the HTML, which means, no more loading bootstrap entirely if you only use 5% of its styles.


# Getting Started
The following is simple setup that will help speeding up your coding experience. It contains automation scripts that, **upon saving**:
- checks your code,
- compiles your files,
- export them into the distribution folder
- and reloads the preview on the browser window.

It doesn't get any better than that.

#### Atom IDE - https://atom.io/
Atom editor is well embraced by the community with tons of packages that will help your development workflow. Sublime Text is also cool, if that's your preference at the moment.

#### Live Server - https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server
**atom-live-server** - this is a quick package for serving files locally, before setting up webpack.

#### Embedded Terminal IDE - https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal

*platformio-ide-terminal* - a terminal package for Atom. Very handy for switching git branches.
